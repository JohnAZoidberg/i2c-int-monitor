This is a Rust project, make sure the compiler has no warnings, cargo fmt is ok, clippy has no errors.
Try to avoid unwrap and unsafe code and keep the code as idiomatic as possible.

There should be github actions file that always builds and lints everything on push.

There should be a readme that's always up to date, describing what the project does and how to use it.
